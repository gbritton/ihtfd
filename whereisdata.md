Different offices at MIT collect different data about student demographics and performance to serve their own needs. This is a basic map of the MIT student data landscape.

The data needed to draw particular conclusions or policy decisions may not have been collected yet. It's possible that sometimes existing data can be combined to make good proxies, but we should point out any limitations of using those proxies.
